Safety is mostly about avoiding extremes. If you take multiple products, overlaps can increase your intake of certain ingredients without you noticing. Keeping a short list of what you take is a simple protection.

Be cautious around marketing that frames supplements as urgent solutions. That framing encourages impulse buying and overuse. A calmer approach is to follow label guidance and discuss any changes with a clinician if you have health conditions or take medication.

The goal is not to fear supplements, but to treat them as optional tools. Tools are helpful when used with clarity and restraint—and less helpful when used as emotional shortcuts.
