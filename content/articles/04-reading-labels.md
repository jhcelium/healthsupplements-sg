Label reading is the most repeatable skill you can build. Start with the ingredient list, not the front-of-pack claims. Marketing lines are designed to attract attention; the ingredient list tells you what you are actually buying.

Next, check serving size and suggested use. Many people accidentally double-count ingredients when they combine products. Then look for cautions or allergen statements, especially if you have sensitivities or take other products.

If a label is vague, uses unclear wording, or leans on dramatic promises, treat that as a signal to slow down. In Singapore's crowded supplement market, "less confusing" is often a sign of a more responsible product presentation.
