Before buying, write down your reason in one sentence. Then check the ingredient list and serving size. If you cannot explain what the product contains, slow down.

Next, consider overlap with what you already take. Many common ingredients appear in multiple products. If you are unsure, ask a pharmacist or clinician with a full list.

Finally, assess the seller and description quality. Clear details, stable contact information, and restrained claims are good signs. If you feel pressured by timers, "limited stock" messages, or extreme promises, that is usually a reason to pause rather than buy.
