One common misconception is that "more expensive means better." Price often reflects branding, packaging, and distribution, not necessarily suitability for you.

Another trap is treating supplements like an urgent fix. If your buying decision is driven by anxiety, it is easy to purchase too many products at once and lose track of what you are taking. A calm approach is to introduce changes slowly and keep simple notes.

Finally, many people over-trust dramatic language. If a product relies on extreme claims, urgency, or "miracle" framing, step back. A good product description should be clear, specific, and boring.
