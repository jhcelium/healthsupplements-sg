Health supplements are products intended to add nutrients or other ingredients to your diet. In Singapore, you may see them sold in pharmacies, supermarkets, and online marketplaces.

A practical way to think about supplements is that they sit between food and medicine. They are not a substitute for medical treatment, and they are not automatically "needed" just because they exist. Most people use them to cover perceived gaps, support routines, or simplify daily habits.

Before buying anything, try to name your real reason in one sentence. If the reason is vague ("I just want to be healthier"), it may be better to start with basics like sleep, meals, and activity, and treat supplements as optional support rather than a main strategy.
