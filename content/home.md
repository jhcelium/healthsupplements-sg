## What this site is about

This site is a calm, text-focused reference for people in Singapore who want a practical overview of health supplements. It does not sell products, make treatment claims, or give personal medical advice.

## Singapore: pharmacy vs online

Singapore residents encounter supplements in pharmacies, supermarkets, and online platforms. Buying in-store lets you speak directly with a pharmacist about label reading and ingredient overlaps. Online platforms offer wider variety and price comparison, but require more careful seller verification — look for stable product information, clear contact details, and reasonable ingredient descriptions.

## Japan perspective: consistency over quick fixes

In Japan, supplements tend to be treated as a quiet, steady part of a daily routine rather than a solution to an urgent problem. Small, repeatable habits — consistent timing, moderate amounts, regular review with a clinician — are valued over intensive short-term use. This mindset can be useful when evaluating whether a product fits your life in Singapore long term.
