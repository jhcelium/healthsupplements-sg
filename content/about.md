## Purpose

This site exists to give Singapore residents a grounded, non-commercial starting point for supplement research. It is written with a restrained tone — no guarantees, no dramatic claims, no urgency tactics.

## What this site does not do

It does not recommend specific products, brands, doses, or treatment plans. It does not offer medical, diagnostic, or clinical advice of any kind.

## Approach and tone

Content is written with a Singapore audience in mind, shaped in part by how long-term supplement habits are discussed in Japan. The goal is to help you form better questions for your own clinician, not to replace that conversation.
