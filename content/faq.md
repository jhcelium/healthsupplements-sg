faq:
  - q: Are health supplements regulated in Singapore?
    a: Health products in Singapore are subject to general regulatory requirements covering safety and labelling, but the level of individual product assessment varies by category. Regulations provide a baseline, not a guarantee of personal suitability.
  - q: How do I buy supplements online safely in Singapore?
    a: Look for sellers with clear contact information, stable product descriptions, and readable ingredient lists. Be cautious of listings with extreme promises, minimal detail, or pressure-based pricing.
  - q: What should I look for on a supplement label?
    a: Focus on the ingredient list, serving size, suggested use, and any caution or allergen statements. If the language is vague or the claims are very strong, take extra time before purchasing.
  - q: Is it safe to take multiple supplements at the same time?
    a: Combining products can increase your total intake of certain ingredients. Everyone's health background differs, so show your clinician or pharmacist a complete list of what you plan to take.
  - q: Are supplements safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?
    a: These situations require individual clinical assessment. Always consult your own clinician before starting, changing, or stopping any supplement when pregnancy or breastfeeding is involved.
  - q: Can supplements interact with my prescribed medication?
    a: Some supplements can affect how medications work. Only a clinician or pharmacist who knows your full medication list can assess this properly. Bring product labels to your next appointment.
  - q: Are online reviews a reliable way to choose supplements?
    a: Reviews reflect individual experiences and cannot account for your personal health situation. Treat them as background context rather than guidance, and be alert to reviews that sound promotional.
  - q: Will taking more than the suggested amount work better?
    a: Taking more than the suggested amount does not reliably improve outcomes and may introduce risks. Follow the label as a starting point and discuss any changes with your clinician.
  - q: Can I replace prescribed medication with supplements?
    a: Supplements are not a substitute for prescribed treatment. Never change, reduce, or stop prescribed medication without speaking first with the clinician managing your care.
  - q: How long should I try a supplement before deciding?
    a: There is no single timeline that applies to everyone. Keep simple notes on how you feel, and discuss your observations with a clinician during routine reviews rather than making decisions alone.
  - q: What is a sensible monthly budget for supplements in Singapore?
    a: Decide on an amount that fits comfortably within your existing budget without affecting essentials. If a product requires a large upfront commitment, consider whether that level of spend is sustainable.
  - q: How can I avoid impulse purchases driven by marketing?
    a: Give yourself a day before buying anything promoted heavily. Read the label slowly, check one or two neutral sources, and ask yourself whether the product was on your list before you saw the promotion.
  - q: 'What is a "supplement" in everyday terms?'
    a: A supplement is a product intended to add specific nutrients or ingredients to the diet. It is not the same as medicine, and it should not be used as a substitute for medical evaluation when symptoms are present.
  - q: How should I read a supplement label in Singapore?
    a: Start with the ingredient list and serving size, then check the amount per serving, warnings, and any stated allergens. If multiple products contain overlapping ingredients, it becomes easier to unintentionally stack similar compounds.
  - q: Is "more" always better?
    a: Not necessarily. Some nutrients have upper limits, and combining multiple products can increase total intake beyond what you expect. Long-term routines tend to work best when they are stable and periodically reviewed.
  - q: What's the difference between buying at a pharmacy vs online?
    a: Pharmacies make it easier to ask about label interpretation and ingredient overlaps. Online platforms can offer wider selection and price comparison, but you should verify seller credibility, stable product information, and consistent ingredient listings.
  - q: What does "natural" mean on supplement packaging?
    a: '"Natural" is often a marketing term rather than a single regulated definition. Use the ingredient list and manufacturer information as your primary reference, and be cautious about vague claims without clear specifics.'
  - q: When should I be extra cautious?
    a: Extra caution is sensible if you are pregnant, nursing, managing a chronic condition, taking prescription medications, preparing for surgery, or buying products for children. In these cases, clinician guidance matters more than general reading.
  - q: Can I take multiple supplements together?
    a: Many people combine products, but stacking can create overlaps (for example, similar vitamins or minerals across multiple formulas). A simple checklist of what you take and why can help you discuss it clearly with a clinician.
  - q: How do I evaluate credibility without relying on hype?
    a: Prefer clear labeling, transparent manufacturer information, and restrained wording over dramatic promises. If a claim sounds urgent, absolute, or guaranteed, treat it as a cue to slow down and verify.
