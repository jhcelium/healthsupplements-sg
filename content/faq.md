faq:
  - q: Are health supplements regulated in Singapore?
    a: Health products in Singapore are subject to general regulatory requirements covering safety and labelling, but the level of individual product assessment varies by category. Regulations provide a baseline, not a guarantee of personal suitability.
  - q: How do I buy supplements online safely in Singapore?
    a: Look for sellers with clear contact information, stable product descriptions, and readable ingredient lists. Be cautious of listings with extreme promises, minimal detail, or pressure-based pricing.
  - q: What should I look for on a supplement label?
    a: Focus on the ingredient list, serving size, suggested use, and any caution or allergen statements. If the language is vague or the claims are very strong, take extra time before purchasing.
  - q: Is it safe to take multiple supplements at the same time?
    a: Combining products can increase your total intake of certain ingredients. Everyone's health background differs, so show your clinician or pharmacist a complete list of what you plan to take.
  - q: Are supplements safe during pregnancy or breastfeeding?
    a: These situations require individual clinical assessment. Always consult your own clinician before starting, changing, or stopping any supplement when pregnancy or breastfeeding is involved.
  - q: Can supplements interact with my prescribed medication?
    a: Some supplements can affect how medications work. Only a clinician or pharmacist who knows your full medication list can assess this properly. Bring product labels to your next appointment.
  - q: Are online reviews a reliable way to choose supplements?
    a: Reviews reflect individual experiences and cannot account for your personal health situation. Treat them as background context rather than guidance, and be alert to reviews that sound promotional.
  - q: Will taking more than the suggested amount work better?
    a: Taking more than the suggested amount does not reliably improve outcomes and may introduce risks. Follow the label as a starting point and discuss any changes with your clinician.
  - q: Can I replace prescribed medication with supplements?
    a: Supplements are not a substitute for prescribed treatment. Never change, reduce, or stop prescribed medication without speaking first with the clinician managing your care.
  - q: How long should I try a supplement before deciding?
    a: There is no single timeline that applies to everyone. Keep simple notes on how you feel, and discuss your observations with a clinician during routine reviews rather than making decisions alone.
  - q: What is a sensible monthly budget for supplements in Singapore?
    a: Decide on an amount that fits comfortably within your existing budget without affecting essentials. If a product requires a large upfront commitment, consider whether that level of spend is sustainable.
  - q: How can I avoid impulse purchases driven by marketing?
    a: Give yourself a day before buying anything promoted heavily. Read the label slowly, check one or two neutral sources, and ask yourself whether the product was on your list before you saw the promotion.
