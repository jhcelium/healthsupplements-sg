  <h1>Purpose</h1>

  <p>
    This site exists to give Singapore residents a grounded, non-commercial starting point for supplement research. It is written with a restrained tone — no guarantees, no dramatic claims, no urgency tactics.
  </p>

      <li>Make treatment or efficacy claims</li>
      <li>Rank, review, or endorse products</li>
      <li>Provide dosage instructions or personalised supplement plans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Approach and tone</h2>
    <p>
      Content is written with a Singapore audience in mind. The regulatory context, buying environments, and consumer landscape here are distinct — and the guidance reflects that.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone is shaped in part by how long-term supplement habits are discussed in Japan: as a quiet, stable part of a daily routine rather than an urgent intervention. Moderate, repeatable habits — consistent timing, stable intake, and periodic review with a clinician — tend to be more useful than intensive short-term experiments. This perspective is offered as a lens, not a prescription.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is to help you form better questions for your own clinician, not to replace that conversation.
