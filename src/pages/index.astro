  <h1>Health Supplements in Singapore: Evidence-Aware Guidance</h1>

  <p class="subtitle">
    Health supplements in Singapore span a broad range of consumer products. This site focuses on ingredient transparency, label literacy, and regulatory context — not on product recommendations or dosage guidance.

    <h2>What counts as health supplements in Singapore</h2>
    <p>
      Supplement categories in Singapore cover a wide range of consumer products intended to add specific nutrients or ingredients to the diet. Common categories include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Vitamin and mineral supplements</strong> — such as vitamin C, vitamin D, B-complex vitamins, calcium, magnesium, and zinc</li>
      <li><strong>Probiotic supplements</strong> — live microorganism products marketed toward digestive or immune health</li>
      <li><strong>Collagen supplements</strong> — peptide or hydrolysed collagen products commonly marketed for skin, joints, or nails</li>
      <li><strong>Herbal and botanical products</strong> — plant-derived extracts and traditional preparations</li>
      <li><strong>Omega and fatty acid products</strong> — fish oil, krill oil, and plant-based omega-3 sources</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are not medicines. They are intended to supplement the diet and are not approved to treat, diagnose, or prevent any medical condition.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why "evidence-aware" matters</h2>
    <p>
      "Evidence-aware" is not the same as "guaranteed." Evidence-based supplements in Singapore — or anywhere — are products where some supporting research exists, but the quality, size, and applicability of that research varies considerably. Being evidence-aware means:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Asking what population the research involved and whether it applies to you</li>
      <li>Distinguishing between surrogate measures (e.g., a biomarker change) and outcomes that matter to daily life</li>
      <li>Being sceptical of dramatic claims, urgent framing, or absolute guarantees</li>
      <li>Using research as a starting point for questions — not as a substitute for clinical guidance</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      No supplement claim reviewed on this site constitutes a treatment recommendation or efficacy guarantee.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Label basics: reading supplement labels in Singapore</h2>
    <p>
      Understanding supplement labels in Singapore is one of the most practical skills a consumer can develop. Key elements to check on any label:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ingredient list and amounts per serving</strong> — what is actually in the product and in what quantity</li>
      <li><strong>Units</strong> — mg, mcg, IU, CFU, and what they represent for that ingredient category</li>
      <li><strong>Total servings per container</strong> — helpful for comparing cost and planning supply</li>
      <li><strong>Allergen and caution statements</strong> — especially relevant if you have known sensitivities</li>
      <li><strong>Overlap awareness</strong> — if you use multiple products, similar ingredients may stack unintentionally, increasing total intake beyond what a single product suggests</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Ingredient transparency in Singapore supplement products can vary by brand and category. Prefer products with specific, quantified ingredient listings over vague proprietary blends with undisclosed amounts.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Regulation context</h2>
    <p>
      Supplement regulation in Singapore is administered by the Health Sciences Authority (HSA) under the Health Products Act. Key points for consumers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Health supplements sold in Singapore must meet safety and labelling requirements</li>
      <li>Not all health supplements undergo individual pre-market efficacy review — regulatory compliance sets a safety baseline, not a performance guarantee</li>
      <li>Product claims on labels and marketing materials are subject to restrictions on therapeutic claims</li>
      <li>If a product makes strong claims about treating or curing conditions, it may be outside the regulatory definition of a supplement</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For the most current regulatory information, refer directly to the HSA website. This site does not interpret regulatory decisions for specific products.

    <h2>Where people buy: pharmacy vs online</h2>
    <p>
      Singapore residents commonly purchase pharmacy supplements in person at Guardian, Watsons, Unity, and independent pharmacies, and increasingly through online platforms such as Lazada, Shopee, and brand-direct websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pharmacy counters</strong> offer direct access to a pharmacist who can assist with label reading, ingredient overlap questions, and interactions with any prescribed medications. This is particularly useful for first-time buyers, people managing chronic conditions, or anyone taking multiple products simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Online platforms</strong> provide broader selection, easier price comparison, and the convenience of delivery. The trade-off is that you must independently verify seller credibility, confirm that product information is complete and consistent, and make label judgements without in-person support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both channels are valid. The right choice depends on your familiarity with the product, your health context, and your comfort with label interpretation.
